# Lori Kurdi and Turki Clothes Recognition
This project aims to develop an image recognition system that can accurately differentiate between traditional Lori Kurdish and Turkish clothing. By leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system can learn to identify intricate patterns and features characteristic of these clothing styles.

**Dataset**

The dataset should consist of images of Lori Kurdish and Turkish clothing, organized into separate directories for training, validation, and testing. Ensure that each image is labeled correctly and placed in the corresponding directory.
